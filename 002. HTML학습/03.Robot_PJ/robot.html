            It is a mechanical device
            that operates with a program
            (programmable) and performs a
            complex series of actions that
            are difficult, complex, and
            dangerous for humans to perform
            on their own.<br><br>
            Automated robots
            that perform assembly, welding,
            and handling in manufacturing
            plants such as automobile
            production lines are called
            industrial robots , and robots
            that have the ability to
            recognize the environment and
            make decisions on their own are
            called ' intelligent robots '.
            There are also food tech robots
            (meal service robots) that
            perform cooking tasks in
            cafeterias such as schools
            instead of humans .<br><br>
            Robots that
            resemble humans are called '
            androids '. Another meaning is
            'form', and they are also called
            machines with the ability to
            think for themselves. Robots that
            use artificial power work instead
            of or with humans. Usually,
            robots are designed to do the
            work planned by the manufacturer.<br><br>
            The term 'robot' was first used
            by Czechoslovakian playwright
            Karel Čapek in his 1920 play
            "RUR", and has since become
            widely used. The etymology of the
            word robot is the Czech word
